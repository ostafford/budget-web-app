Personal Budget App Project

# Description

This is my personal budget app project. 
i've been currently using google spreadsheet to formulate my budgets. however i'm now wanting to put that into a web app. 

The purpose of this app is to show you an overview of your daily, weekly, monthly and yearly outgoing expenses as well as your incoming. 
This personal spreadsheet that i have created has helped me with my personal debt and finances. The overall benifit of this app will allow me to see how much funds i have remaining when setting re-occuring expenses, being direct debt, rent, etc have come out. 
This so far has helped me see how much i'm owing and how much i have left after outgoing expenses have been made or are going to be made in the future. 
Creating a better looking interface through a webapp will hopefully make it more enjoyable to budget.
